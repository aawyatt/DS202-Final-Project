```

Our question:
Is there a region of the US that has the most UFO sightings?

```{r}
library(dplyr)
```

## Step 1: Cleaning

```{r}
# Steps for cleaning the dataset:

# 1. Filter out all countries except for country = "us". 
ufo1 = ufo %>% filter(ufo$country == "us")

# 2. Capitalize state and city values for cleanliness.

#3. Extract just the year value from date.posted variable.
```

## Step 2: Visual summary (6 out of 8 candidate plots)

```{r}

```
